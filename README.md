# Insurance POC Ontology

Fabric workspace: `sbfabiq`  
Lakehouse: `InsuranceDataLH`  
Ontology: `InsurnaceOntlogy` (Fabric item ID `df3ab284-7783-4196-a652-95276c448a7d`)  
Semantic model: `InsuranceSalesStarSchema`

This repository contains portable exports and documentation for the insurance policy-sales proof of concept created in the Fabric workspace. The data is synthetic sample data.

## Lakehouse Tables

| Table | Role | Expected rows |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `dbo.dimagent` | Agent dimension | 5 |
| `dbo.dimcarrier` | Insurance carrier dimension | 5 |
| `dbo.dimcustomer` | Customer dimension | 5 |
| `dbo.dimdate` | 2026 date dimension | 12 |
| `dbo.dimproduct` | Insurance product dimension | 5 |
| `dbo.factpolicysales` | Policy sale fact | 50 |

The six corresponding seed CSVs are included at the repository root. In the Lakehouse, the originals are under `Files/InsuranceSalesSeed/`.

## Star Relationships

- `factpolicysales.AgentKey` -> `dimagent.AgentKey` (`soldBy`)
- `factpolicysales.CustomerKey` -> `dimcustomer.CustomerKey` (`purchasedBy`)
- `factpolicysales.ProductKey` -> `dimproduct.ProductKey` (`covers`)
- `factpolicysales.CarrierKey` -> `dimcarrier.CarrierKey` (`underwrittenBy`)
- `factpolicysales.SaleDateKey` -> `dimdate.DateKey` (`soldOn`)

The ontology models these same relationships with `PolicySale` as the origin entity and the dimensions as targets. `PolicySale` properties are bound to `factpolicysales`; each dimension entity is bound to its corresponding `dim*` table.

## Semantic Model

`InsuranceSalesStarSchema` is a separate illustrative semantic model. Its native TMDL export is in `semantic-model/`. It currently contains five sample fact rows with 2025 dates; it is not connected to the Lakehouse's 50-row 2026 seed tables. The exported model's dimensions and relationships document the intended star schema, but do not represent the current Lakehouse data.

## Ontology

The ontology follows the Lakeshore tutorial pattern: entity types with Lakehouse property bindings and explicit relationships. `ontology-model.json` is a portable description of the ontology shape, not a Fabric import package. The native ontology remains in the Fabric workspace; this repository does not contain a native Fabric ontology package.
